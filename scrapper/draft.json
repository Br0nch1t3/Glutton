          "content:encoded": "<ul>\n<li>Shiba Inu (SHIB) is facing a sharp decline in price and whale activity.</li>\n<li>SHIB&rsquo;s decline is raising doubts about the meme coin&rsquo;s future in a competitive crypto market.</li>\n<li>Memeinator, a new AI crypto project, aims to dominate the meme coin market with its MMTR token.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, <a href=\"https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/what-is-shiba-inu/\">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> has recently faced a dramatic decline, with its price hovering near yearly lows.</p>\n<p>SHIB&rsquo;s struggles have raised concerns about its future in the crypto market. The once-soaring meme coin has faced several challenges, and its latest setback comes in the form of a mass exodus of large holders, often referred to as &ldquo;whales.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Shiba Inu faces whale exodus</h2>\n<p>Shiba Inu has witnessed a significant drop in the number of substantial transactions on its network, with large holders reducing their activity according to <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce#balances\">data from Etherscan</a>. In the recent past, the number of these transactions significantly dwindled, marking a period of inactivity rarely seen in the meme coin&rsquo;s history.</p>\n<p>Several factors appear to be contributing to this sudden decline in whale activity.</p>\n<p>One potential reason for this exodus is the waning interest in highly volatile assets like SHIB. With Bitcoin&rsquo;s dominance on the rise, many investors might be shifting their focus from riskier assets to more established ones. Bitcoin&rsquo;s stability and status as a flagship cryptocurrency have drawn investors looking for safer options in these uncertain times.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/\">SHIB&rsquo;s price</a> performance over the past few weeks has been less than inspiring. Currently trading at $0.000006861, the meme coin has dropped by over 33% since the start of 2023.</p>\n<div class=\"fr-img-space-wrap\"><span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable\" style=\"width: 615px\"><span class=\"fr-img-wrap\">\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.igms.io/2023/09/11/1697025649817-01ac5521-63d3-4422-a0c0-fc3fff0e82e9.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" width=\"615\" height=\"233\"><span class=\"fr-inner\" style=\"background: transparent;position: relative\">SHIB price performance over the years</span></p>\n<p></p></span></span>\n<p class=\"fr-img-space-wrap2\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p>This underwhelming performance could discourage large holders, leading them to reduce their activity or even offload some of their SHIB holdings.</p>\n<h2>The general decline of meme coins</h2>\n<p>The decline in whale activity within the Shiba Inu ecosystem mirrors a broader sentiment shift in the <a href=\"https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/cryptocurrency/\">cryptocurrency</a> market. As the crypto space matures, investors are increasingly discerning, gravitating toward assets with strong fundamentals and practical use cases.</p>\n<p>Meme coins like Shiba Inu, driven primarily by social media hype and celebrity endorsements, have a difficult time sustaining long-term interest and growth. While SHIB had its moments in the spotlight, the current landscape requires more than just social media buzz to maintain a coin&rsquo;s value.</p>\n<p>In such a competitive and evolving market, meme coins must adapt to changing dynamics, provide genuine utility, and offer something unique to investors to maintain and grow their user base.</p>\n<h2>Memeinator MMTR Token: a new AI-driven meme coin</h2>\n<p>Amid Shiba Inu&rsquo;s challenges and declining interest in meme coins, a new project known as <a href=\"https://memeinator.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news\">Memeinator</a> has entered the scene with a bang following the launch of its token presale.</p>\n<p>Memeinator, a self-proclaimed &ldquo;ultimate meme coin,&rdquo; plans to dominate the meme coin market with the aid of AI technology, viral marketing, and a clear mission: to hit a $1 billion market cap.</p>\n<p>The project aims to launch new products, including the Memeinator game and the Memescanner, along its journey.</p>\n<p>MMTR, the token associated with the Memeinator project, is positioned to become a staple among top-tier meme coins with genuine utility. The tokenomics of the MMTR token include allocations for presale, marketing, development, exchange liquidity provision, and a competition pool.</p>\n<p>Memeinator has outlined a roadmap for its development, consisting of several phases. The project started by forming a team and building a community. It is now developing its blockchain as it conducts its token presale and it also prepares to engage in powerful marketing. As it progresses, Memeinator will partner with influencers and platforms, introduce staking, and release exclusive NFTs.</p>\n<p>The later phases of Memeinator&rsquo;s roadmap include listing on Tier 1 exchanges, launching the Memescanner, and releasing the Memeinator game.</p>\n<p>The Memeinator team has made it relatively straightforward for potential investors to participate in the <a href=\"https://memeinator.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news\">MMTR token presale</a>. By connecting their crypto wallet to the Memeinator presale site, investors can send the desired token to their wallet, supporting multiple cryptocurrencies, including ETH, USDT, and USDC.</p>\n<p>Participants can then swap their chosen token for MMTR, making sure they have the necessary cryptocurrency in their wallet to cover transaction fees. Investors will be able to claim their MMTR tokens after the presale concludes.</p>\n\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coinjournal.net/news/shiba-inu-struggles-amidst-whale-exodus-as-memeinator-presale-takes-off/\">Shiba Inu struggles amidst whale exodus as Memeinator presale takes off</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coinjournal.net\">CoinJournal</a>.</p>",

The difference is stunning if one looks at the market capitalization of the entire industry today and compares it with, say, ten years ago.</p>\n<p>So, knowing what drives people to invest in cryptocurrencies is interesting.</p>\n<p>Guess no more.</p>\n<p>A study by the Federal Reserve, called <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/banking/consumer-payments/survey-diary-consumer-payment-choice/2022/dcpc2022_codebook.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Reserve&rsquo;s 2022 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice</a>, sheds light on this topic. So here are the main three reasons why investors hold crypto:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Great potential investment</li>\n<li>People are interested in new technologies</li>\n<li>Some do not trust the US government or the US dollar</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Most individuals own crypto as an investment</h2>\n<p>The overwhelming majority of individual investors own cryptocurrencies because they believe it is a good investment. More precisely, 67% of investors are crypto owners only from an investment perspective.</p>\n<p>While this is impressive, it also tells much of the industry. It means that most investors are just speculating and hoping for higher prices than the ones they paid.</p>\n<p>Coupled with the fact that only 0.3% of the respondents said they use it to buy goods and services in the United States, it tells much about the main reason people invest in cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<h2>Many own crypto because they are interested in new technologies</h2>\n<p>Another reason to own crypto is that investors want to have exposure to new technologies. 20.7% of investors are interested in new technologies, which is a good enough reason for them to buy and hold cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<h2>Lack of trust in the US government or the US dollar</h2>\n<p>1.6% of investors do not trust the US government or the US dollar. While not a big number, it reflects investors&rsquo; belief that the US government&rsquo;s policies failed to support the local currency, and thus, investors turned to cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>The rest of the respondents fell into other categories, which sum up to 8.6%.</p>\n\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coinjournal.net/news/top-3-reasons-why-investors-own-cryptocurrencies/\">Top 3 reasons why investors own cryptocurrencies</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coinjournal.net\">CoinJournal</a>.</p>",

Hacken will now take on the role of the primary security code auditor for projects operating on the Radix platform.</p>\n<p>Radix, known for its full-stack capabilities and layer-1 smart contract platform, is a pioneering platform that allows developers and users to engage with Web3 and <a href=\"https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/defi/\">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a> through decentralized applications (dapps). At the core of Radix&rsquo;s offerings is its Scrypto programming language, which streamlines the creation and execution of smart contracts.</p>\n<h2>Enhancing security in the Radix ecosystem</h2>\n<p>Hacken brings to the table a team of over 60 cybersecurity experts and a thriving community of white hat hackers and security researchers. These experts are well-versed in the unique Scrypto programming language specific to the Radix network and have immersed themselves in the technical intricacies of the Radix execution environment, consensus algorithm, and the broader network ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Piers Ridyard, the CEO of RDX Works, expressed his satisfaction with the collaboration, stating that they have been incredibly impressed with Hacken&rsquo;s professional approach, deep technical competence, and comprehensive audit process. He also added that Radix, as a new technology stack with novel coding language and execution environment, demands thorough scrutiny.</p>\n<p>This partnership is aimed at conducting thorough code audits that will serve to reinforce the security of the Radix ecosystem, particularly the various dapps operating on the platform. While it may not offer an absolute guarantee of security, the audits will undoubtedly enhance the robustness of these decentralized applications, instilling greater confidence among their users.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://coinjournal.net/radix/\">price of the Radix (XRD) token</a> surged briefly reaching a high of $0.0458 immediately after the partnership news broke but it had pulled back to $0.04414 at press time.</p>\n<h2>Shiba Memu: an AI-powered meme token</h2>\n<p>While Redix seeks to improve the security of its ecosystem through partnership, an emerging player in the cryptocurrency arena, <a href=\"https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news\">Shiba Memu</a>, is creating a buzz with its innovative approach to marketing and promotion.</p>\n<p>Unlike most meme tokens that heavily rely on human-led marketing efforts, Shiba Memu is pioneering the use of AI technology to drive its marketing strategies. This unique approach sets it apart as a compelling investment option.</p>\n<p>The token is described as a showstopper, capable of performing the work of multiple marketing agencies. It continuously monitors and identifies the most promising developments in creative advertising, and not just during regular working hours but around the clock.</p>\n<p>Shiba Memu&rsquo;s innovative marketing capabilities, powered by AI technology, enable it to create marketing strategies, write press releases, and promote itself in various online forums and social networks. This self-sufficiency distinguishes Shiba Memu from traditional meme tokens.</p>\n<h2>Shiba Memu&rsquo;s AI marketing strategies</h2>\n<p>The core of Shiba Memu&rsquo;s strategy lies in its AI-driven approach to generating a wealth of content. The token plans to publish content on a wide array of platforms, including forums and social media.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it will meticulously monitor and analyze the performance of its marketing efforts, making real-time adjustments to optimize results. This agile approach mirrors the principles outlined in &ldquo;The Art of War.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shiba Memu&rsquo;s AI technology goes a step further by enabling direct interaction with users through a dedicated dashboard. Users can communicate with the AI, offer feedback, make suggestions, and ask questions. This unique feature offers a direct line of communication with Shiba Memu&rsquo;s AI-powered marketing genius.</p>\n<h2>Shiba Memu presale and future prospects</h2>\n<p>The Shiba Memu project envisions significant growth and potential. The team aims to deliver long-term investment opportunities for holders while providing attractive returns for day traders. The project is focused on creating viral content and achieving unprecedented levels of success in the <a href=\"https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/cryptocurrency/\">crypto market</a>.</p>\n<p>The project&rsquo;s token was launched on the Ethereum blockchain, with 85% of the total token supply made available to the community in the ongoing <a href=\"https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news\">Shiba Memu presale</a>.</p>\n<p>In Q1 2024, Shiba Memu plans to list its native token on major centralized exchanges, increasing liquidity and accessibility for users and investors.</p>\n<p>Q2 2024 will see the development of an AI marketing dashboard visible to users. Machine learning algorithms will also be integrated to analyze successful marketing strategies. The AI marketing dashboard will be launched to the community in Q3 2024, allowing users to engage with the AI, provide suggestions, and integrate with social media platforms for marketing activities.</p>\n<p>In Q4 2024, Shiba Memu plans to expand its marketing efforts to new markets and communities. The project will also partner with influencers and content creators to promote its brand before integrating with decentralized applications in Q1 2025.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The partnership between Radix and Hacken is set to enhance the security of the Radix ecosystem, instilling confidence in users and developers.</p>\n<p>In parallel, Shiba Memu, with its pioneering use of AI technology for marketing, aims to make a significant mark in the world of cryptocurrency.

USDC is a fiat-backed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/stablecoin/\">stablecoin</a>&nbsp;redeemable that&rsquo;s 1:1 for US dollars.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the Philippines central bank Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas, remittance inflows stood at a whopping $36.1 billion in 2022. But while these transfers play a crucial role in the country&rsquo;s economic growth, the impact of huge fees and transaction delays related to conventional payment channels has been huge.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A recent World Bank report indicated that the average remittance fee via traditional rails was $200, or roughly 5.7% in 2022. USDC will greatly reduce the costs, with Coins.ph and Circle eyeing the United Nations&rsquo; target of 3% or lower for migrant remittances costs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The use of USDC also promises financial inclusion to more people, including the 44% of the Philippine adult population that remains unbanked.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;<em>By making cross-border transactions near real-time and dramatically reducing transaction costs, we support the United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goal of reducing to less than 3 percent the transaction cost of migrant remittances by 2023. Together, we&rsquo;re making critical steps toward increasing economic opportunity and prosperity in the Philippines</em>,&rdquo; Raagulan Pathy, Circle&rsquo;s VP for Asia Pacific, said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coinjournal.net/news/circle-and-coins-ph-partner-for-usdc-remittances-in-the-philippines/\">Circle and Coins.ph partner for USDC remittances in the Philippines</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coinjournal.net\">CoinJournal</a>.</p>"
